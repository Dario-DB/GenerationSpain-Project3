Working group project (4): JavaGoesQuiz 

It consists in  a quiz game written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It has been carried out taking another similar project as a reference.
  
  1. You can choose a player name.
  2. There are questions of two themes: green and general knowledge (even you can play a mix of them).
  3. You can choose the number of questions you want to answer (between one and ten).
  4. You have 15 sec to answer each question.
  5. Questions have an aleatory order. Each time you play, the order changes.
  6. When the quiz is finished, you get a resume of the game (total questions, correct answered, incorrect answered and  unanswered).
